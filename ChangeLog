	* GA-poly-max.py (main): structured this main() function to have a
	simple flow of advancing one generation.  The main loop is now tiny.
	(advance_one_generation): new function to handle each generation.
	(print_pop_stats): new function which takes on the functionality
	of printing the fitness status at this point.
	(calc_pop_fitness): new function which calculates the fitness of
	the entire population.
	(print_pop): new function, not used right now, which prints out
	the current population.
	(print_metadata): new function which prints a starting metadata
	block for the program.

	* GA-poly-max.py: adapted the crossover function to the current
	approach of using ieee representation of floating point numbers.
	Also separated out two separate approaches to mating: the mate
	that is intrinsically binary, and the one which does a simple
	drift on the floating point values.
