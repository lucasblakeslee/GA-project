TITLE: Entorpy in Evolution

Motivation: Our motivation for this project was to get our toes wet in the rapidly evolving field of thermodynamics which includes entropy.




























PURPOSE: The purpose of this project is to find out the relationship between the opitimization or evolution of a species and its result on entropy or diversity.

HYPOTHEISIS: We hypothesise that as a species gets more optimal the entropy will fall as options become unusable as the generations advance.

MATIERIALS: This project was computer based so you will need Scipy and our git repository: https://github.com/lucasblakeslee/GA-project.git

Procedure: Run python3 Ga-poly-max.py
