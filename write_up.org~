TITLE: Entorpy in Evolution

PURPOSE: The purpose of this project is to find out the relationship between the opitimization or evolution of a species and its result on entropy or diversity.

HYPOTHEISIS: We hypothesise that as a species gets more optimal the entropy will fall as options become  as the generations advancedue to mutations.

MATIERIALS: This project was computer based so you will need Scipy, Struct, and our git repository

Procedure: Run python3 Ga-poly-max.py

Abstract: In this project our goal was to 

Conclusion:
